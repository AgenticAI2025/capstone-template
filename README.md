# Capstone Project Overview


This capstone project aims to develop an advanced Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection system using LangGraph's multi-agent workflow orchestration framework. The system will address critical limitations of traditional rule-based AML systems by implementing a flexible, transparent, and scalable solution capable of detecting sophisticated money laundering schemes.
